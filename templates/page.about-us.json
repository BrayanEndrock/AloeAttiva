This is vital for your youthful look as well as your comfort: constant skin irritation from environmental factors is known to hasten premature aging, and worsen any concerns you are already experiencing, such as the look of lines, dryness, redness, or fatigue. <\/p><p>These powerful skin benefits derive from aloe’s cocktail of polysaccharides, or complex sugars. A typical aloe plant contains 1,000 to 2,000 mg\/kg polysaccharides, but our proprietary extraction technique (performed in a secret lab in Italy) yields a concentration of at least 6,617 mg\/kg. In fact, our Aloe Attiva Elixir is proven to be 4x more effective than regular aloe. Our aloe is responsibly sourced from around the world, and we accept nothing less than the highest quality.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/collections\/all\" title=\"Best Sellers\">SHOP WATERLESS<\/a><\/p>"

At age 18, he began as an apprentice formulating vitamins behind the tablet press. His passion for safe and natural ingredients in beauty and wellness spans has continued and deepened over 25 years. His fascination for Aloe, one of the most trusted skincare ingredients, and known for its calming, soothing, and regenerative properties, led him to study the famous plant in great depth.<\/p><p>Vernazza’s Aloe Attiva Elixir, created through a proprietary and confidential methodology, is an extraordinary extract, proven to be 4x more effective than commercially available aloe preparations. This potent Elixir is at the heart of every formula we make. Apart from replacing plain water, which can dilute efficacy, the Elixir helps improve and enhance the overall formulations. The result: aloe-powered, waterless beauty products that are clean, natural, and exceptionally effective.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/collections\/shop-all\" title=\"Shop All\">SHOP WATERLESS<\/a><\/p>"
